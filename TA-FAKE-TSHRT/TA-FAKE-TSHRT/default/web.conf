# Expose custom REST endpoints for dashboard access
# Ref: https://github.com/splunk/splunk-app-examples/blob/master/custom_endpoints/hello-world/default/web.conf
#
# Without this file, the endpoints defined in restmap.conf are only
# accessible via splunkd (port 8089), not via Splunk Web (port 8000).
# This is required for dashboard JavaScript to call the endpoints.
