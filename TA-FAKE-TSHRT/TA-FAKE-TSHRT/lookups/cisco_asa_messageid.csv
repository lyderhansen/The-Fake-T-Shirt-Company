Unicast RPF, also known as reverse route lookup, detected a packet that does not have a source address represented by a route and assumes that it is part of an attack on your Secure Firewall ASA. This message appears when you have enabled Unicast RPF with the ip verify reverse-path command. This feature works on packets input to an interface; if it is configured on the outside, then the Secure Firewall ASA checks packets arriving from the outside. The Secure Firewall ASA looks up a route based on the source_address. If an entry is not found and a route is not defined, then this message appears and the connection is dropped. If there is a route, the Secure Firewall ASA checks which interface it corresponds to. If the packet arrived on another interface, it is either a spoof or there is an asymmetric routing environment that has more than one path to a destination. The Secure Firewall ASA does not support asymmetric routing. If the Secure Firewall ASA is configured on an internal interface, it checks static route command statements or RIP, and if the source_address is not found, then an internal user is spoofing their address.","Even though an attack is in progress, if this feature is enabled, no user action is required. The Secure Firewall ASA repels the attack."

In addition, the ip verify reverse-path command is not configured. For example, if a user starts a connection on the inside interface, but the Secure Firewall ASA detects the same connection arriving on a perimeter interface, the Secure Firewall ASA has more than one path to a destination. This is known as asymmetric routing and is not supported on the Secure Firewall ASA. An attacker also might be attempting to append packets from one connection to another as a way to break into the Secure Firewall ASA.

This message provides more information than message 106023, which only logs denied packets, and does not include the hit count or a configurable level. When an access-list line has the log argument, it is expected that this message ID might be triggered because of a nonsynchronized packet reaching the Secure Firewall ASA and being evaluated by the access list. For example, if an ACK packet is received on the Secure Firewall ASA (for which no TCP connection exists in the connection table), the Secure Firewall ASA might generate message 106100, indicating that the packet was permitted; however, the packet is later correctly dropped because of no matching connection. The following list describes the message values: • permitted | denied | est-allowed—These values specify if the packet was permitted or denied by the ACL. If the value is est-allowed, the packet was denied by the ACL but was allowed for an already established session (for example, an internal user is allowed to accesss the Internet, and responding packets that would normally be denied by the ACL are accepted). • protocol —TCP, UDP, ICMP, or an IP protocol number. • interface_name —The interface name for the source or destination of the logged flow.

The IP address is the real IP address instead of the values that display through NAT. • source_port —The source port of the logged flow (TCP or UDP). For ICMP, the number after the source port is the message type. • idfw_user— The user identity username, including the domain name that is added to the existing syslog when the Secure Firewall ASA can find the username for the IP address. • sg_info— The security group tag that is added to the syslog when the Secure Firewall ASA can find a security group tag for the IP address. The security group name is displayed with the security group tag, if available. • dest_port —The destination port of the logged flow (TCP or UDP). For ICMP, the number after the destination port is the ICMP message code, which is available for some message types. For type 8, it is always 0. For a list of ICMP message types, see the following URL: http://www.iana.org/assignments/icmp-parameters/icmp-parameters.xml. • hit-cnt number —The number of times this flow was permitted or denied by this ACL entry in the configured time interval. The value is 1 when the Secure Firewall ASA generates the first message for this flow. • first hit—The first message generated for this flow. • number -second interval—The interval in which the hit count is accumulated.
